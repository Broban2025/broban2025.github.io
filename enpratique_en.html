        <h2>Transportation</h2>

        <h3>If you have a car</h3>
        <p>The church and castle are located about 1 hour north of Paris, via the A1 motorway, less than 10 minutes apart.</p>
        <p>If you can offer carpooling spots in your car, please don't hesitate to
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TcoYagFMNkCpMI9T4_6Rkrdb9KP7W6FYzfNfcmLgHxs/edit?gid=0#gid=0">
          indicate it here</a></p>

        <h3>If you don't have a car</h3>
        <p>You can fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TcoYagFMNkCpMI9T4_6Rkrdb9KP7W6FYzfNfcmLgHxs/edit?gid=0#gid=0">
          this carpooling form</a> so we can connect you with people who can offer rides</p>

        <h3>In any case</h3>
        <p>To avoid having to drive after the party (there might be some alcohol served), we
        will arrange shuttles for transportation:
        <ul>
          <li>From a hotel (that is currently being identified) to the church - Departure at 3:30 PM from the hotel parking lot</li>
          <li>From the church to the castle - departure at 5:30 PM after the ceremony</li>
          <li>From the castle to the hotel, first departure at 1 AM then at a frequency to be determined</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>This way you can first go to the hotel to check in, and the shuttles will take care of the rest!</p>    
        
        <h2>Accommodation</h2>
        <p>We are currently looking for a hotel where we can gather after the celebration. We will try to secure preferential rates for the wedding guests.</p>
        <p>Many guesthouses and hotels are within a 10-minute drive. In particular, the Saint-Witz hotel area
        offers several budget-friendly hotels</p>
